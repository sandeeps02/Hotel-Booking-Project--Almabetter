# Hotel-Booking-Project--Almabetter
Project Summary -
This is a project that aims to provide insights into consumer preferences, trends, and patterns in the hospitality industry. By analyzing the data on hotel bookings,we can gain valuable insights into what factors are most important to guests, what types of rooms are most popular, and how hotel bookings vary over time.

The data needs to be cleaned and preprocessed to remove any duplicates, missing values, or outliers. This also involve's transforming some variables and creating new variables to make the data more useful for analysis.

After the data is cleaned, the next step is to perform exploratory data analysis using tools such as box plots and scatterplots,etc. This helps us to understand the distribution of the data, identify any patterns or trends and outliers, and visualize any relationships between variables.

Finally, we can use data visualization tools such as graphs, charts, and tables to communicate our findings and insights to stakeholders, such as hotel managers, investors, or marketing teams. This can help them to make more informed decisions about pricing, marketing, and other business strategies.

Define Your Business Objective?
To gain insights and make data-driven decisions to optimize the hotel's operations and improve customer experience.

The goal of this project is to help the client increase their revenue and market share in the highly competitive hotel industry.

5. Solution to Business Objective
What do you suggest the client to achieve Business Objective ?
Explain Briefly.

Based on the analysis we did on the data, we found out very interesting insights from it which can directly or indirectly affect the business outcome in a positive way if followed with the right methodology.Some of the suggestion's that the client has to follow for the same are as follows:

Only agent "9" have higher number of bookings so we have to develop some competition among the agents by providing some perks, which motivates agent to give their best.
By increasing the room type A and H, which is more likely among the coustomers makes more revenue and gain of heigher profits.
As BB type meal is major demanding meal of restraunts, so hotel can use their meal as advertisment and ear more profit.

By seeing the choice of hotel, we can suggest our coustomer to make more investment among city hotel and gain more profit.

The resort hotels are not doing well as the market standards so they have make some changes and increase the booking, and gain coustmers interest towards their hotels.

Customers prefer city hotel for short stay so we can increase the price of the city hotel, which makes more profit.

For long stay customer prefers the resort hotel so we have to providing some extra services which is attractive toward the customer and gain more profit.

TA/TO platform can be use as a marketing platform, hotels can use this platform to showcase the highlights of hotels and gain more intrest of customers.

Conclusion
The hotel booking analysis project has provided valuable insights into the booking patterns and preferences of customers. Through a comprehensive analysis of the data, we have identified several key factors that can significantly impact the business outcome of the client. The following conclusions can be drawn from our analysis:

1.Customer preferences: The top countries of guests origin are Portugal(PRT),Great-Britain(GBR),France(FRA),Spain(ESP) and others.

City Hotel is more preferred by the customers than Resort Hotel.

BB type meal is preferred mostly by the Guests and after that SC followed by HB. FB type is least preferred by the guests.

TA/TO platform most preferd for the hotel booking.

2.Seasonal trends: The number of reservations is generally highest in the summer months (July and August) and lowest in the winter months (December and January).

The ADR of City Hotel is more than ADR of Resort Hotel for all Customer Types for all the Months except for JULY and AUGUST in which the ADR of Resort Hotel is significantly high.

Resort hotel arrival is almost same at every day but city hotel vary more.

3.Market Segmentation: Agent "9" made most number of booking.

Most common stay length is less than 4 days.

TA/TO is mostly used for planning Hotel visits ahead of time. But for sudden visits other mediums are most preferred.

While booking via TA/TO one may have to wait a little longer to confirm booking of rooms. GDS channel brings higher revenue generating deals for City hotel, in contrast to that most bookings come via TA/TO. Resort hotel has more revnue generating deals by direct and TA/TO channel.

"H" type room generate more revenue but "A" type room have higher booking rate.
